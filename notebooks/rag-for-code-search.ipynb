Given tree is rooted, so there exists only one vertex which doesn't have a parent — it's the root of a tree. Every vertex has an integer number written on it. Following algorithm is run on every value from the tree *T*:\\n 1.  Set pointer to the root of a tree. 1.  Return success if the value in the current vertex is equal to the number you are looking for 1.  Go to the left child of the vertex if the value in the current vertex is greater than the number you are looking for 1.  Go to the right child of the vertex if the value in the current vertex is less than the number you are looking for 1.  Return fail if you try to go to the vertex that doesn't exist \\nHere is the pseudo-code of the described algorithm: \\n\\nThe described algorithm works correctly if the tree is binary search tree (i.e. for each node the values of left subtree are less than the value in the node, the values of right subtree are greater than the value in the node). But it can return invalid result if tree is not a binary search tree.\\n\\nSince the given tree is not necessarily a binary search tree, not all numbers can be found this way. Your task is to calculate, how many times the search will fail being running on every value from the tree.\\n\\nIf the tree has multiple vertices with the same values on them then you should run algorithm on every one of them separately. \\n Input Specification: First line contains integer number *n* (1<=≤<=*n*<=≤<=105) — number of vertices in the tree.\\n\\nEach of the next *n* lines contains 3 numbers *v*, *l*, *r* (0<=≤<=*v*<=≤<=109) — value on current vertex, index of the left child of the vertex and index of the right child of the vertex, respectively. If some child doesn't exist then number <=-<=1 is set instead. Note that different vertices of the tree may contain the same values. \\n Output Specification: Print number of times when search algorithm will fail. \\n Demo Input: ['3\\\\n15 -1 -1\\\\n10 1 3\\\\n5 -1 -1\\\\n', '8\\\\n6 2 3\\\\n3 4 5\\\\n12 6 7\\\\n1 -1 8\\\\n4 -1 -1\\\\n5 -1 -1\\\\n14 -1 -1\\\\n2 -1 -1\\\\n'] \\n Demo Output: ['2\\\\n', '1\\\\n']\", 'code': 'from sys import stdin\\r\\ninput=lambda :stdin.readline()[:-1]\\r\\n\\r\\nn=int(input())\\r\\npar=[-1]*n\\r\\nleft=[-1]*n\\r\\nright=[-1]*n\\r\\na=[0]*n\\r\\nfor i in range(n):\\r\\n  v,l,r=map(int,input().split())\\r\\n  a[i]=v\\r\\n  l-=1\\r\\n  r-=1\\r\\n  if l!=-2:\\r\\n    par[l]=i\\r\\n    left[i]=l\\r\\n  if r!=-2:\\r\\n    par[r]=i\\r\\n    right[i]=r\\r\\n\\r\\nroot=-1\\r\\nfor i in range(n):\\r\\n  if par[i]==-1:\\r\\n    root=i\\r\\n\\r\\nok=set()\\r\\ntodo=[(root,0,10**9+10)]\\r\\nwhile todo:\\r\\n  v,L,R=todo.pop()\\r\\n  if L>R:\\r\\n    continue\\r\\n  if L<=a[v]<=R:\\r\\n    ok.add(a[v])\\r\\n  if left[v]!=-1:\\r\\n    todo.append((left[v],L,min(R,a[v]-1)))\\r\\n  if right[v]!=-1:\\r\\n    todo.append((right[v],max(a[v]+1,L),R))\\r\\n\\r\\nans=n\\r\\nfor i in a:\\r\\n  if i in ok:\\r\\n    ans-=1\\r\\n\\r\\nprint(ans)'}, vector=None, shard_key=None, order_value=None),\n",

Apples that end up in first inflorescence are gathered by Arcady in exactly the same moment. Second peculiarity of this tree is that once two apples are in same inflorescence they annihilate. This happens with each pair of apples, e.g. if there are 5 apples in same inflorescence in same time, only one will not be annihilated and if there are 8 apples, all apples will be annihilated.

    "## Reciprocal Rank Fusion\n",
    "Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) is a technique used to combine multiple rankings into a single ranking. It is a simple and effective way to improve the quality of the ranking.\n",
    "\n",
    "RRF works by assigning a score to each document based on its rank in each individual ranking. The score for a document is calculated as the sum of the reciprocal of its rank plus a constant k. The formula for the RRF score is:\n",
    " \n",
    "$$\\text{RRF score} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{k + r_i}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where \\( n \\) is the number of rankings, \\( r_i \\) is the rank of the document in the \\( i \\)-th ranking, and \\( k \\) is a constant (typically set to 60) to ensure that all documents receive a non-zero score.\n",
    "\n",
    "RRF does not require the rankings to be normalized or the scores to be on the same scale, making it a robust and flexible method for combining rankings from different sources."
